To Do:
1. I have an interactive allocation on, 3 tasks, 2 cpus-per-task, 2 nodes 
   himem[01-02]

    Figure out why :
    a) srun -n2 --mpi=openmpi --jobid=2431623 ./a.out
       --> Spawns two mpi-tasks (both taskID=0), one on each node

    b) srun --mpi=openmpi --jobid=2431623 mpirun -n 2 ./a.out
       --> Spawns 4 mpi-tasks. It seems like it is the equivalent to running
           mpirun -n 2 on each node
